11/12/2025: Introduction to Source Code Management in DevOps
=============================================================
 kind of process which is used to maintain clean code across the project life cycle
 is kind of automated life cycle 
 
 cicd pipeline: 
      build files 
	  pipeline files --> jenkins file 
	  playbook files --> yaml file using ansible  
      k8s manifest files
      iac files --- terraform script
      shell scripts
      docker files
      compose files
      config/settings/properties files
      gitops
	  
 scm: --store, track , manage and how to collaborate the cd
   application code 
   iac code 
   configurations 
   ci/cd pipelines 
   documentation 
 
why do we need scm in devops: 
----------------------------- 
  to maintain versioning of the code  
  versions: Enhancement of the existing code/build/file/artifacts
  collaboration between developers 
  
  rollback capability during failure 
  how to handle the release 
  
  tree --> origin-trunk --> branches-leaf --tags
  
  secure control 
  access control 
  
  branching stratagies
  traceability:
  integrations with devops 
  
  local repo: git  
  remote repo: github 
  

 
 pull: execute automated build at schedule times 
 push :execute automated build when there is change is happened at repository
 
 How to handle the release
 --------------------------
  tree -> origin ->
  
 gitinstallation.sh
  #!/bin/bash
  
  if command -v git > /dev/null 2>&1
  then
      echo git
	  
	  
12/12/25: 
===========
git is DVCS:
------------
 checkin
 checkout

cvcs:
-----
 if it crashes - development stops
 no offline commits/should be online
 
dvcs: distributed version control system:GIT
---------------------------------------------
1) can work at offline
2) can have complete copy of repo at your workstation-local repo
3)repository import
4) branch mapping
5) version history
6) with out overriding can collaborate with others
7)rollback
8) pipelines, terraform-iac file
9) release management

basic terms:
 git --- tool ---- commands --- local repo
 github -- repo ---- remote repository
  branch :
   current linear development 

what is repository:
---------------------
folder with .git directory

work flow:
----------
working directory --- unstaged/untraked area ---- staging area/index area --> commit area 


git:
----

Build area --> Index area --> Commit area 
 mkdir myrepo
 git init
 
  web hooks:
   server side hooks
   client side hooks
   
  git status
  touch f1 f2
  git status   #track new changes in working dir 
  git add .    
   cd .git
   cd head
  git status 
  git commit -m "message"
  git log 
  git shortlog 
  
  
15/12/25: Remote Repository
===========================

 porceian commands : user firendly commands: git add,git log...
                   : high level commands 
				   
 plumbing commands : low-level internal commands 
                   :debugging corrupted repos 
				   :writing coustom git automation 
				   :ci/cd analysis 
				   :to understand how git is store the data
				   
what is remote repositiry?
---------------------------
 *is a distributed repository where we will share the code and maintain the code 
 *github is not a tool 
 *is repository used for hosting service 
 *Provides centralized collaboration for the distributed teams 
 *types oof repos:
      public and private repos 
	  
 *we will maintain the private repo at corporate level 
 *DevOps engineer will handling the repo: framework 
 *maintain full git history 
 *need to handle repos at deff leve : per project,organizarion 
 *uses branches for parallel development 
 *what is branch 
   is linear independent work flow 
   
 *default branch is : master/main
 *github enable forking repositories  # to create copy of remote repositories 
 *github support PR workflows  #Pull request 
 *PR enables code review before merge 
 * supports RBAC (Role based Access control) -> Github/Jenkins/docker/k8s/aws-IAM
 *user, team can work at organizational level 
 * x ---> push the code to repo at feature branch -> owner define some mandatory reviewers 
 *workflow automation 
 *branch protection rules  -> must avoid direct commits 
 *quality gates 
  track the issue /tasks/bugs/enchacements
 *webbooks -->restAPI
 *proper version, builds, patches are numbering --tags --release 
 *ci/cd automation -->githubaction  #define workflows -yaml 
 
 
 
why we need remote repository? 


16/12/2025: public and private repository
==========================================
 create public and private repository 
 .git 
 
 how to access the github repo:
 ------------------------------
 via ssh
 via 
 
 cd /opt/
 sudo yum install git 
 git --version 
 
 
 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -c"raghav@gmail.com"  #secure hashing algorithm
 
 
17/12/2025:
=================


why we need remote repository?
------------------------------
what is master
what is origin/master
git branch
git branch -a
git restore -- staged . --- moves the files from the traked to untracked
git clone
  * deep cloning    --> taking full history of the github
  * shallow cloning --> latest commits only/no commit full history

  git clone --depth=1 *github url  
  git log | wc -l #print recent commits 
  git log 
  git log --oneline 
  
  git clone
  git pull: download+merge 
  git fetch --download
  
  git name-rev --name-only *
  
 Q: can you convert shallow clone to deep clone
 ------------------------------------------------
 git fetch --unshallow 
  
  
18/12/25: Branch
==================
 is a pointer t commit 
 current development workflow 
 master/main 
 development 
 feature 
 bugfix 
 hotfix 
 patch 
 experiment without affecting the master/main code 
 
 without banches:
 ----------------
 only one line of development
 have risk of breaking production environment
 no parallel development/work

 with branches: 
  parallel development 
  clean,precise ci/cd pipeline 
  easy rollback 
  team collaboration 
  
 real DevOps engineer: 
 --------------------- 
  1. CI: 
       pull: execute an automated build at schedule time 
	   push: execute automated build where there is change is happen at specific branch of repo 
	   runs on feature branches 
	   
  2. CD: happen only from stable branches: 
  master
  
 where are branches used: 
  feature development: 
  feature/payment-api 
  
  bug fixing 
  release 
  hotfix 
  
 cicd pipelines:
  
 when soft code freeze happens:
 -----------------------------
  1. branching rules 
  2. cicd rules 
  3. human approval 
  
 what is hard code freeze: 
  show stopper bugs 
  
 how hardcode feeze is enforced in git:
  1. branch protection 
     lock the branch 
	 disable merge permission
  2. ci/cd lock 
  3. org policy 
  4. feature flags 
  
  github/gitlab 
  
 branching commands:
 -------------------
  git branch 
  git checkout 
  git merge 
  git push origin branchname 
  git diff 
  git rebase
  
 short-lived branches 
 long -lived branches 
 
 
 
 
  build
  version
  patch
  hotfix
  fixpack
  major.minor.patch.buildno
  major-minior.hotfix.buildno
  
  
  
19/12/25: Branch 
=================
Local Branch 
------------ 
List with last commit: 
 git branch -v 
 git pull 
 git push 
 git fetch 
 git branch -a 
 git branch branchname 
 git checkout branchname 
 git branch --merged  #list merged branch 
 git branch --no-merged
 git merge feature  #from master branch #fat-forward 
 
 what is fast-forward merge: 
 --------------------------- 
 
 --pending
 
26/12/2025: GitHub Action
==========================
 what is Github: 
 ---------------
 what is github and its features from the devops perspective
  -what is organization: 
           
  what is project
  what Is team
  how to set the boundaries to the teams and users
  what is GitHub:
  
  how to use GitHub and its features from the devops prospective
  what is organization
  how to add the users to the teams
  how to create the repositories
  how to apply repo and level, project and organizationlevel
  settings
  how to integrate the apps with GitHub to automatesomekind of work flow
  
  
  -- pending 
  
29/12/2025 - Pull Request (PR)
===================================================
 Audit and history 
 ----------------
 every change has 
  who cahanges
  why changess 
  when changed 
  
 when we for PR:
 ----------------
  1. adding new feature 
  2. fixing a branch 
  3. hotfix in production 
  4. Refactorization code 
     testcase -- fail-red --test-green 
  5. infra changes 
      k8s yaml 
	  .tf files 
	  ci/cd pipelines 
	  
 flow of PR:
 -----------
  create a new branch 
  make code chamges 
  push branch to github 
  create PR 
  review + comments 
  CI checks pass 
  manage PR 
  
  branch deletion 
  
PR rules/complainces:
--------------------- 
* FEATURE+REFACTOR+CONFIG CHANGES ---- PR
* give proper menaning-ful PR TITLE and
description
* PR --- review --- minium approval
* ci must pass before merge  
   build fails 
   tests fail 
   security scans fails 
   
* note: only PR-based merges should allow 
* delete branch after merge 

 git clone vs git fork 
 
 Branch protection:
  SAST
  DAST 
  
CI -first steps 
  code checkout --> Dependency analysis --> code compile 
 

 
30/12/2025: Github-action
============================
* GitHub/bitbuckey/GitLab/code commit/azurerepo

*what are the github-actions: 
------------------------------
 is ci/cd platform
 is a kind automation tool
 used to automate work-flow --- when something happens in repo-need to automate that flow
 yaml-based flow
  
*Multiple things are happen-something --> events
  event: --> PR 
        create the branch 
	    any issues
	    code push 
	    merged 
	    release 
* Must be inside the repository 
* Path: githubrepo/.GitHub/workflows/demo.yaml 
* Workflows 
* workflows are defined in yaml file 
* every workflows has a name  
* workflow is triggered by one or more event 
* workflow contains jobs
    collections of task is jobs 
* Jobs are running on runners : - self-hosted runners 

* types of runners in GitHub:
----------------------------- 
1. github-hosted runners 
   vm : ubuntu,windows,mac 
   run-on: ubuntu-latest 
   
2. Self-hosted runners 
   can run on our servers/vms/cloud instances  
   
3. Organization-level runners 
    large-level 
	large enterprises 
	multiple-team using CI Infra 
	
4. repository level-runners 
5. grouped runners: 
     logical grouping of sel-hosted runners 
6. ephemeral self-hosted runners 
7. large/high -performance runner --paid

02/01/2026: GitHub Action Project
================================== 
 Build github-actions -workflow -to deploye web application to tomcatserver:
 ------------------------------------------------
 
 Seen how to generate the package using Java+maven via githubactions 

 step1: Create Ec2 Instance
 step2: download and install tomcat server on ec2-server
 step3: lets unzip/untar the tomcat directory
 step4: try to configure the tomcat-user
 step5: start the tomcat server
 step6: access the tomcatsever-ui
 step7: build the githubactions
 step8: run the work-flow to deploy war to remote server-mumbai-
 
 

 
5/01/2026: Github-action -Project 
==================================
GitHub : https://github.com/sresrinivas/Ebusiness.git

build workflow for the following actions:
-------------------------------------------
 1) raise the PR
 2) review the PR
 3) Perform Merging
 4) if any conflicts or not try to send notification to the user via slack
 
 CI: 


  ---practical session---


06/01/2026: Build Automation:
=============================
What is build: 
--------------
 is a set of executable source code generated after compilation.
  20 devlopers -- 20 pieces as files --- integration --one final piece 

 build process: converting source code in to runnable , deployable as artifacts.



build format:
=============
 language -- code -- java ---> jar/war/ear/image 
             code -- .net ---> dll 


without build what happens:
---------------------------

 
why do we need build: 
---------------------
 consistency 
 repetability
 traceability 
 
 
Types of builds:
----------------
 nightly build 
 ---------------
  patch build: bug fix /security 
  hotfix build 
  release build 
  Development build 


How th builds are trigger: 
---------------------------
 Manual build 
 automated build : --CI-SERVER-JENKINS 
 Scheduled: -- pull 
 Event-driven build: push,PR,merge 
 
Based on architecture:
----------------------
 monolithic
 microservice
 serverless 
 
 node.jjs: .tgz,buldle 
 python: .whl, tar.gz
 go:   binary 
 docker: --image 
 k8s: helm chart 
 
 front end: --- static assets 

Build Automation:
-------------------
 build tools: 
 ------------- 
  used to automate the build process 
  
  Java: --> maven, gradle 
  node.js: --> npm,yarn,pnpm 
  .Net : msbuild 
  python: poetry 
  go --go build 
  
  
07/01/2026: Application Engineering 
====================================
working for the applications/environments/schedules/deliveries/client not for the tools

 *design
 *build
 *structured
 *configured
 *deployed
 *reliable
 *scalable
 *testable
 *automated under diff environment

health/logs/metrics


Key reasons start at application engineering:
----------------------------------------------
 1. Security starts at application configurations 
 2. Weak app design 
 3. CI/CD pipelines operated on applications not tools 
 4. maven+docker -- image 
 
What to focus in application:
------------------------------
 Application fundamentals:
  language & runtime 
  entry point 
  build system 
  
Application life cycle:
-----------------------
  startup   # init - like initalize pre service before start the main service 
  shutdown behavior 
  failure modes 
  retry logic 
  graceful termination
  
Configuration model:
---------------------
 environment variables
 config files 
 .kube/ configuration module
 secret handling 
 runtime overrides 
 
Dependency model:
-----------------
 Database 
 external service 
 caches
 message brokers
 
Observability:
--------------
 logs 
 metrics 
 health checks 
 error handling

1. Application structure and design 
------------------------------------
 1. Know the application entry points : -spring boot, node index.js, main 
   * understand how the app stops 
 2. build and packing 
 
 
 
07/01/2026: Introduction to Maven
===================================
what is maven: 
-------------- 
 is a build tool 
 used to automate the build process  
 is written in java 
 platform independent 
 platfom: OS+Processor 
 opensource 
 follows the conventions rather than configuration
 
 require a build file: ---xml based 
 build file:--> pom.xml 
 what is pom --> project object model 
  used for project management purpose  
  used for reporting 
  
 have its own predefined life cycle 
 defines the order of exxecution 
 supports the order of lifecycyles 
  default 
  clean 
  site 
  
 *lifecycle -- phase -->plugins --> goals
 *Dependency management tool 
 Repository : local, remote, central repo: mvnreposotory.cm
 build cache 
 portability of the build  

 dev/qa/uat/sit  -profiles
 maven with +CI SERVER tools
 maven+git+svn+codecommit+azurerepo
 maven+docker+ansible+k8s+
 maven cli ->mvn
 maven+multiple server
 can do deployment, undepployment , rdeployment
 
 maven proper project tree structure

 Java architecture 
 
 
09/01/2026: Maven - regular terms used in DevOps
==================================================
CI-Server 
---------- 
 Jenkins 
 GitLab ----> Build file ---Java--> pom.xml
 githubactions 
 azuredevops 
 pom -->Project object model 
 build automation 
 dependency management 
 
Maven:
-----

build tool:
-----------
order of build execution
3 life cycles :---- default/clean/site

artifacts ---- final output ----- > jar/war/ear/image

what is dependency: 
------------------- 
 software dependency 
  xml elements  --- gav properties  #group ID ,srtifact ID, version 
  
dependency managemnnt
---------------------

artifact 
---------
 output ---->war/ear/image/jar 
 artifactID+code----  /op ----- artifacts -- jar

version:
--------- 
 1. snapshot 
 2. release 
 
snapshot: 
---------- 
 development version ---still changing, not final 
 
release:
----------
 stable and production -ready version 
 
packaging:
-----------
 format of artifact --output 
 
what is pom.xml:
---------------
 pom.xml 
 
 build file/maven configuration file 
 
repository :
------------
 storage location for artifacts and dependencies
 
 
nexus/jfrog
image --- dockerhub/ecr/acr/

local repository:
-------------------:

~/.m2/repository

remote repository:
------------------------:

custom repository hosted inside the company/organization

     nexus/jfrog-artifacttory/dockerhub/ecr/acr


build lifecycle:
-----------------

lifecycle --- phases ----- plug-ins --- goals

phases :
-----------:

collections of predefined steps that will help to maintain the order of build execution

   default:---23 
   site:
   clean

plug-in:
----------
 extension to maven used to perform task 
 

Maven configration: 
-------------------
 cd opt/
 yum git  -y 
 git clone ------  #
 mvn validate 
 mvn compile 
 mvn test 
 mvn package 
 
buiod ssection
---------------
 
what is dependency tree: 
-------------------------
  
what is metadata:
----------------
 version 
 packages 
 checksums
 
 
--pending 




========================================
10/01/2026: what is archetype in maven 
=======================================
 it is a project templete generator
 create a project with predefined structure, filels, directories and configurations 
 
 understand the application architype
 -------------------------------------
  desktop application 
  microservices 
  web application 
  enter-prise
  
 when run the archetype , maven creates 
  - src/main/java ----------> development code 
    src/main/resources 
	src/test/java   --------> testing code: ----> UNIT Testcases/IT 
	
why maven Introduced Archetype:
--------------------------------
 Project consistency 
 reproducibility 
 standards 
 faster project bootstrapping 
 
how many types of archetypes: 
------------------------------
 1. official maven archetype 
 2. framework specific archetypes 
     spring boot 
	 micronut
	 camel 
	 quarkus 
	 Jakarta EE
 3. coustom corporate archetype 
 
Why devops engineers need to know archetype: 
----------------------------------------------
 Must understand project standards --CI/CD 
 
 Automation at scale 
 
 devops must creates organization templetes 
   microservices templetes 
   testing templete
   docker templete 
   CI/CD 
   k8s deployment 
   
 enables the GITOPS + Platform engineering 
 
 archetype + helm + k8s + argocd 
 security and complience 
 dependency management 
 dependency analysis
 


==========================================
12/01/2026: what is acrchetype in maven
=========================================
Project templete --- create structure 
dev---push the code ---github --integrate in to CI Server --- run the CI pipeline --checkout the code 
---> verify the code is having proper mandate files or not -- build file--pom

 mvn archtype:generate -DgroupId=com.srini.eapp -DartifactId

 validate, initialize, generate-sources, process-sources, generate-resources, process-resources, compile,
process-classes, generate-test-sources, process-test-sources, generate-test-resources, process-test-resources,
test-compile, process-test-classes, test, prepare-package, package, pre-integration-test, integration-test,
post-integration-test, verify, install, deploy


what is source:
----------------
 all java releate files that need to compiled in to byte code--.class --
 build = collection of .class 
 
 what are resource in maven:
 ---------------------------- 
 non-java files needed by the application during the runtime 
 
 
 
 
19/01/2026: Introduction to pom.xml:
===================================== 
 it is a build file 
 is a configuration file 
 dependencies 
 build plugings 
 
 project versions: major.minor.patch 
                 : major.minor.build 
				 :major.minor.hotfix
