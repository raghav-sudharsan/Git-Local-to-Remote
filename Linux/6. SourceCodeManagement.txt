11/12/2025: Introduction to Source Code Management in DevOps
=============================================================
 kind of process which is used to maintain clean code 
 
 pull: 
 push:
 
 How to handle the release
 --------------------------
  tree -> origin ->
  
 gitinstallation.sh
  #!/bin/bash
  
  if command -v git > /dev/null 2>&1
  then
      echo git
	  
	  
12/12/25: 
===========
git is DVCS:
------------
 checkin
 checkout

cvcs:
-----
 if it crashes - development stops
 no offline commits/should be online
 
dvcs: distributed version control system:GIT
---------------------------------------------


basic terms:
git --- tool ---- commands --- local repo
github -- repo ---- remote repository
branch 

what is repository:
---------------------
folder with .git directory

work flow:
----------
working directory --- unstaged/untraked area ---- staging area/index area --> commit area 


git:
----

Build area --> Index area --> Commit area 
 mkdir myrepo
 git init
 
  web hooks:
   server side hooks
   client side hooks
   
  git status
  touch f1 f2
  git status   #track new changes in working dir 
  git add .    
   cd .git
   cd head
  git status 
  git commit -m "message"
  git log 
  git shortlog 
  
  
15/12/25: Remote Repository
===========================

 porceian commands : user firendly commands: git add,git log...
                   : high level commands 
				   
 plumbing commands : low-level internal commands 
                   :debugging corrupted repos 
				   :writing coustom git automation 
				   :ci/cd analysis 
				   :to understand how git is store the data
				   
what is remote repositiry?
---------------------------
 *is a distributed repository where we will share the code and maintain the code 
 *github is not a tool 
 *is repository used for hosting service 
 *Provides centralized collaboration for the distributed teams 
 *types oof repos:
      public and private repos 
	  
 *we will maintain the private repo at corporate level 
 *DevOps engineer will handling the repo: framework 
 *maintain full git history 
 *need to handle repos at deff leve : per project,organizarion 
 *uses branches for parallel development 
 *what is branch 
   is linear independent work flow 
   
 *default branch is : master/main
 *github enable forking repositories  # to create copy of remote repositories 
 *github support PR workflows  #Pull request 
 *PR enables code review before merge 
 * supports RBAC (Role based Access control) -> Github/Jenkins/docker/k8s/aws-IAM
 *user, team can work at organizational level 
 * x ---> push the code to repo at feature branch -> owner define some mandatory reviewers 
 *workflow automation 
 *branch protection rules  -> must avoid direct commits 
 *quality gates 
  track the issue /tasks/bugs/enchacements
 *webbooks -->restAPI
 *proper version, builds, patches are numbering --tags --release 
 *ci/cd automation -->githubaction  #define workflows -yaml 
 
 
 
why we need remote repository?
