Job Automation:
==============
to run script
to run some playbooks
to run some kind of jobs In k8s
to run schedule jobs in Jenkins
job scheduling: execution of specific command//script

could be one time(low system usage ) or
recurring based on -predetermined time in the feature

CI ---- Pull based mechanism:executing an automated build at scheduled
time


tools
--------
 daemons --background process
 
 1. atd
 2. crond
 3. systemd tiimers
 
 atd: -at time deamon
 ---------------------
  at time - one time execution in the feature
   at 9:pm backscript.sh    - relook the execution next day 
   
 crond:
 ------
  /var/spool/cron
  /etc/cron.d 
  
   at 9:pm backscript.sh    - No relook the execution next day 
  
 controlling user access:
 -------------------------
 allow & deny   - /etc/directory
 
 at -> at.allow, at.deny
 cron -> cron.allow, cron.deny
 
Schedular
-----------
 /var/log/cron file
 
 
Scheduling jobs with at command:
---------------------------------
 /var/spool/at   - save location
 at
 atq
 atrm
 
 syntax:
 -------
 syn: at 1:20 am
       at noon --12am
	   at 12:50
	  at midnight --12 am
     at now + 5 hrs
    at 3:00 1/1/2026 command
    at 3:00 1/1/2026 -f /path of script file
    at -f /home/ec2-user/scripts.sh now 3 hrs

install the at if it is missed:
------------------------------
yum install -y at

 at 11:10 am tomorrow
 atq
 
 sudo ls /var/spool/at   #job id
 atq
 at -d 5    #remove target job with id
 atq
 atrm 1     #at remove with job id
 
 atq | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -r atrm
 atq
 
 
 to run specif jobs when the system load become low:
 ---------------------------------------------------
 
batch: is a command to run the job when the system load is low
     : system decide the best time to run the script
	 
	  
echo "hello , welcome to job automation in linux " > /tmp/output. txt
batch
 at> echo "please execute jobs at $ (date) "
 at> /tmp/output.txt


CPU-intensive tasks - batch
=============================
crond:

crontab:
 cron table  #time table
 
 vi /etc/crontab
 
# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...

# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name command to be executed


 yum installed | grep cron
 
 
 crontab expression
 ---------------------
 to run the script everyday at 5:30 am  - 30 5 * * *
 to run the script everyday at 11pm every day - 
 

 
18/11/25: Service management in linux
=======================================

What  is service:
 these are the background program /tasks
 
 sshd--handles ssh login
  dockerd
 webserver--nginix
 
 systemd
 
 what is service management
 ----------------------------
  controlling the life cycle of background service
   start service 
   stop service
   restart service 
   reload configuration
   enable/disable auto-restart at boot
   checks the logs and status
   
   systemd - systemctl
   
   what is the diff between process and services
   --------------------------------------------
    sevice- 
	
	auto-start at boot --- yes
     unit file
    each service is a process
 not every process is a service

 Nginix
 -------  
 socket: protocol://ipaddress:port
 80
 security groups - inbound/outbound
 
 which nginix 
 whereis nginix
 whatis 
 
 
 
 
 sudo yum install -y nginix
 sudo systemctl start nginix
 sudo systemctl stop nginix
 sudo systemctl status nginix
 sudo systemctl edit nginix
 " reload        # if any changes made in nginixconfigurations , must reload
 
 man ln
 sudo systemctl list-units --type=service
 sudo systemctl list-units --type=service | wc -l
 sudo systemctl list-units --type=service | grep "nginix"
 
 sudo systemctl is-active nginix   
 sudo systemctl is-enabled nginix
 
 which nginix 
 whereis nginix
 whatis 
 
 cd ~
 cd /etc/nginix
 
 mask/unmask
 -----------
  man systemctl
  cd
  sudo systemctl mask nginix
  sudo systemctl status nginix
  " stop
  systemctl start nginix   # we cant start
  " unmask
